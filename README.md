We can check if a number is square or triangular or both.


A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. 
The nth triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side, 
and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. 


In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, 
it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 9 is a square number, since it can be written as 3 Ã— 3.
